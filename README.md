> Experimental Debugging for CU UI

This is currently interacting with the remote debugging for CEF.

Currently this will just log `FPS` every second.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository and run:

```
npm install
```

Then start your client to ensure the remote debugging is running on `localhost:8088`

Then run the following

```
node main.js
```
